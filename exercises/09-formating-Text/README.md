# `09` Formating Text


The way word processing documents work is pretty standard, you always see the same stuff: Headings, bold text, paragraphs, quotes, etc.

HTML was meant to replicate that exact behavior. Here is and example of a typical document that can be replicated with HTML:


**Instructions:
Please write the code to replicate the exact same styles with pure html, use headings, paragraph, strong, blockquote, ol and il.**

--------BEGIN OF THE EXAMPLE ------

# This will be your heading

Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read, in the middle of the text you want to highlight a strong statement that will blow everybody's mind using bold text. Then you can quote someone to add credibility:

>*A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business.*
**â€• A.A. Milne, If I May**

Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new generations have this things in common:

1.Don't like to read long texts.

2.Have the spawn of attention of a bird.

3.Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.
