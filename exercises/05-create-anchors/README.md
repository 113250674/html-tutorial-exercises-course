## `05`Create anchor tag

Add to the website body an anchor tag that says `Click me to search on google`

The anchor should takes the user to the url [http://google.com](http://google.com) when clicked.

The result should look like this:

![Link url](http://i.imgur.com/GGj8vBu.png)

### Note:
To be able to test it instead of clicking on it, you should right click and select "open in a new tab" because Repl.it is blocking the normal click for security reasons.

### ðŸ’¡ Hint
The given url is an ABSOLUTE path because it starts with "http", that means that you are telling the browser that you are going to be taking the user OUTSIDE of your website.
